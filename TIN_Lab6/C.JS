// c)	Write a JS function to validate contents of a form â€“
//  the form should have at least one mandatory numerical field and one field to be checked with a regular expression 
//  (e.g. an e-mail). Fields not passing validation should have their style modified to inform the user.
//  The JS function should return false if form fails validation, true if it passes.
